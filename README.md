## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a 3.5e D&D player
- They play a Spellcaster and need to manage thats characters spell and spell slots
- The problem this app solves for them is that 3.5e D&D has hundreds of spells per class. This app allows the user to filter through the spells and prepare(favorite) what spells they use, as well as manage all their spell slots.

## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->

- Each character has their own Prepared spells screen which shows all of their Prepared/favorite spells
- Each character has their own Known spells screen which only shows the user spells their character can cast based on class and level
- Each character has their own Spell Manager which shows the characters spell slots and how many they have. The Spell slots are based on their class, level, and spell casting ability
